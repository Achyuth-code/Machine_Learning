## Course Modules 🧠

Each module focuses on a different machine learning technique. Start with the basics and work your way up!

1. **Linear Regression** 📏  
   Learn how to build a simple linear regression model, understand linear relationships, and evaluate model performance.

2. **Multiple Linear Regression** 📐  
   Expand on linear regression by including multiple predictors to improve the model's accuracy and predictive power.

3. **Polynomial Linear Regression** 🔄  
   Discover how to capture non-linear relationships in data by extending linear regression with polynomial features.

4. **Logistic Regression** 📉  
   Dive into classification with logistic regression, a powerful model for binary and multiclass classification problems.

5. **Clustering** 🔍  
   Explore unsupervised learning with clustering techniques like K-means, perfect for discovering patterns in unlabeled data.

6. **Decision Tree** 🌳  
   Understand decision tree classifiers, a popular model for interpretable predictions in both classification and regression.

7. **Support Vector Machine (SVM)** 🔲  
   Learn about SVMs, a robust model for classification that works well with complex boundaries and non-linear data.

8. **Random Forest** 🌲  
   Discover ensemble learning with random forests, a model that combines multiple decision trees for higher accuracy.

9. **Feature Selection** 🔎  
   Practice techniques to select relevant features, improving model efficiency and reducing overfitting.

10. **t-SNE** 🔬  
   Visualize high-dimensional data with t-SNE, a popular technique for dimensionality reduction and clustering visualization.

11. **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)** 📐  
   Reduce dimensionality with PCA to uncover key patterns and simplify data for further analysis.

## Usage 🚀

Each module is designed to be self-contained. To run a specific module:

1. Navigate to the relevant directory under `modules/` (e.g., `modules/Linear_Regression`).
2. Open the corresponding Jupyter Notebook (e.g., `linear_regression.ipynb`) or Python script for that module.

For example:

```bash
cd modules/Linear_Regression
jupyter notebook linear_regression.ipynb
```
